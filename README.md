# NetGet-Preview

NetGet aims to provide organisations with an easy to use tool for managing software bundles in a BYOD environment.
To achieve this it uses winget, Microsoft's new package manager for Windows.
By utilizing the winget community repository, the catalogue of software available in NetGet is ever expanding.
The software bundles are saved in a MySQL database, allowing for immediate updates. Anywhere, anytime.

English language is planned for RC1.<br>
